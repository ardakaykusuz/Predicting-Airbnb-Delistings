# Predicting-Airbnb-Delistings
Airbnb is a widely recognized online platform and hospitality marketplace that offers a diverse range of accommodations, including apartments, houses, and individual rooms listed by hosts. The platform has revolutionized how people find and book accommodations, providing unique and personalized lodging experiences across the globe. In this project, our primary objective is to develop a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline capable of predicting whether a listed property will be unlisted in the upcoming quarter. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can accurately forecast the unlisting status of properties on Airbnb. 
Please see the project description files. 

- Train (train.xlsx) (6,248 lines): Contains the Airbnb and host descriptions (“description” and “host_about” columns), as well as the information regarding the property listing status (“unlisted” column). A property is considered unlisted (1) if it got removed from the quarterly Airbnb list and it is considered listed (0) if it remains on that same list. 
- **Train Reviews** (train_reviews.xlsx) (361,281 lines): This file has all the guests’ comments made to each Airbnb property. Note that there can be more than one comment per property, not all properties have comments, and comments can appear in many languages. 
- **Test** (test.xlsx) (695 lines): The structure of this dataset is the same as the train set, except that it does not contain the “unlisted” column. The teaching team is keeping this information secret! You are expected to provide the predicted status (0 or 1) for each Airbnb in this set. Once the projects are delivered, we will compare your predictions with the actual (true) labels. 
- **Test Reviews** (test_reviews.xlsx) (41,866 lines): The structure of this dataset is the same as the train reviews set, but the comments correspond to the properties present on the test set. Note that you are not required to use all the textual fields from the provided corpora as input for your model. For example, your best solution may just use the “description” column as input.
